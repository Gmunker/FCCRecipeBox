### [FreeCodeCamp ReactJS Recipe Box App](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box)

The idea of this project is to create a Recipe Box to store Recipes in Local Storage. Allow users to add new recipes, revisit to see there recipes in a list, as well as edit, and delete.

My goal will to go a few steps further. I will utilize OAuth login using Firebase, I will also use Firebase as a database storage for all recipes so they are always accessible by the users.

What is planned to be used in this app is as follows:

* ReactJS
* Redux
* Thunk
* momentJS


* NodeJS
* Firebase


* Karma
* Mocha
* Expect
* Deep Freeze

I'm sure more will find it's way into the list while i'm learning/creating this project!
